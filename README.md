### Summary
Your EPK is an Electronic Press Kit tool that allows a user to input a film's information and generate a professional press kit for film promotion. This React web app is designed to be highly interactive, allowing the user to visualize their final press kit by editing the film information in a mock-up format the mirrors the final EPK's layout. A user can generate and edit multiple EPKs, which allows for targeted EPK design aimed at specific media if neeeded.
